# Some interesting questions
How to scroll down the list all the time with messages after redraw? (overflow-anchor I couldn't start)

Why don't work CSS selectors like :last-child :nth-child :last-of-type? (Maybe problem in Transfer-Encoding: chunked)

Have any idea? [Tweet me](https://twitter.com/iwonzimin) or [Email me](mailto:hello@iwonz.ru). Thx!
